The Number Guessing Game is a short java project where computer generates a random number and the user has to guess the number within the certain number of tries.
The program is implemented using a "while" loop structure where the user has given 8 tries to guess the number generated by the computer system.

The number of tries is traced by the counter variable. If the user's guess is incorrect, the computer will provide a feedback to the user whether the guess 
is too high or too low.

As the number of turns ends for the user it will display the status of user whether it has won the game or lose.
if the user loses the game, the system will show the random number which was supposed to guess.
it will show the number of tries to get the random number and score out of 100 based on it.
